Creating Dynamic UI with Android Fragments
Chapter 1: Fragments and UI Modularization

This project is the Fragment-based application built for platforms that natively support Fragments (API Level >= 11).
This project represents the application as the chapter ends. This project is specifically set to target devices on Android 4.0 (API Level 14) or higher
To see this same application built to support pre-API Level 11 devices, see the project in the FragmentSupportLibImplementation folder.

This version of the app displays the Fragments but they do not yet interact. That ability gets added in Chapter 2.

Project created with Android Studio version 0.2.4 (the version publicly available on 15-August-2013)

NOTE: When opening the project Android Studio will sometimes report a "NullPointerException". This can be ignored; the project will open and build fine.
