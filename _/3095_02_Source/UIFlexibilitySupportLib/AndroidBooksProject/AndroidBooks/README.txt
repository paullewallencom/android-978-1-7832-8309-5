To see this same application built to target only those devices with native Fragment support, see the project in the UIFlexibilitySupportLib folder.

Project created with Android Studio version 0.2.4 (the version publicly available on 15-August-2013)

NOTE: When opening the project Android Studio will sometimes report a "NullPointerException". This can be ignored; the project will open and build fine.
